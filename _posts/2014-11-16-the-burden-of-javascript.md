title: The burden of JavaScript
---

The _burden_ of JavaScript - a weird way to start with a few positive thoughts on JavaScript, I know. But it portraits my relationship with the language.

Don’t get me wrong. I do like java script. I _**actually**_ do like it. There are not many people who would agree with a statement such as "JavaScript is a decent language", and even I wouldn’t. Yet I do like it. It hasn't always been this way. It's been some time since I dipped my toe into that lake, filled with tears of JavaScript developers, and I added my portion to it.  

When you start with the language you don’t feel empowered, you are not drawn in by the beautiful concepts of the language. There is not a lot of constructs that make you think "hey - neat". But if not the language itself, what do I like about it? 

> I do like it due to reasons I should actually hate it for. Reasons that individually are quite toxic, but when appearing together allow the ecosystem of javascript to grow and form.

## Simplicity allows Pre-Paradigm development
JavaScript is so simple it lacks many higher “design” concepts (OO). But that is not what I mean with pre-paradigm. In the JavaScript world we have seen an enormous speed of development not only with frameworks but also libraries, platforms and yes, even paradigms. A community that feels empowered to start from the ground up fuels it. Reinventing package management, build management, development processes, protocols, architectures, hell even the debugger, UI concepts and programming styles. 

> Simplicity allows to truly rethink paradigms
    
It is hard to imagine that such a radical evolution of the java or c# landscape could take place. In those languages you wander through shiny cities. JavaScript is a mud field. But there are so many kids out there, willing to build the next mud castle. 

> "But wait. There are a lot of simple languages out there, many of which are far more beautiful” you say? True. And that’s precisely why they don’t get the kids in the mud. The place is to clean. 


## Badness enforces Pre-Paradigm development
Now that’s the twist. The reason I like it, is **because** it is so bad. The language has without question many flaws, many problems, addressed by many smart people. Even though I want it to be better I do think there is some value in a bad language. Having a language not act the way you want it to forces you to learn something about the internals. Yes, I’m talking about hoisting, “this”, etc. The complexity JavaScript bombards you with, once you try to develop a decent application can be horrifying. But it forces you into the source, into reading about its internals. Developing such a habit is enormously helpful for a decent developer, if not even mandatory. And it leads you to carefully think about the language, the ecosystem and the existing paradigms. Especially since the language itself has so many problems.

> Badness takes away the option to rethink. It enforces it.

It forces a subset of us to, one day, not knowing what we are starting or where it will take us, say _"I’m gonna fix that"_. With this, JavaScript has forced it’s community in a unique way to jump into a Pre-Paradigm phase.


## Pre-Paradigm forces you into reinventing
I like JavaScript’s problems because, once learned they do **not** provide much value. Pointers in c ? Sure, that’s a helpful concept for every language. The misuse of "this"? Not so much. And that is precisely why developers like you and me contribute to the ecosystem. The lesson from JavaScript is not what you learn about the language, but the habit to dig deep, to throw away and constantly iterate. 

> Without a good paradigm - you have to reinvent and implement

You don't reinvent because the language was so simple and allowed it. But because it was so simple and **demanded** it. And only with this demand, this force in our backs, have we started to rethink and reimplement. We see ideas pop up and being implemented that surfaced in academia 40 years ago but were dismissed. And we see a ton of new concepts and ideas appearing that haven’t been seen. 

> "It had to be **bad** and **popular**"
> - Gary Bernhard

Yep, Mr Bernhard, I agree. It had to be popular as well. Without it beeing popular the community would have switched to another technolgie. Rethinking, inventing and iterating can be a burden. But a burden the community has to take.

## Notes
* Yes, Dart is too clean.
* To some extent, learning about JavaScript’s internals, is also dangerous for developers. You might think that you understand more about the language than you actually do. Confidence in your knowledge of the underlying system can make you a worse programmer. But that’s a topic for another day.
* This list is not meant to be “complete”. There are various other reasons for / against certain languages.
